**MY FAVORITE MOVIES**
1. The hills have eyes
   > It is about a family that is went on a vacation but targeted by a group of cannibalistic mutants after their car breaks down in the desert.
  
2. Spider-Man No Way Home
   > Peter turns to Doctor Strange to make the world forget that he is Spider-Man. The spell goes horribly wrong and shatters the multiverse, bringing in monstrous villains that could destroy the world.

3. Trolls
   > It centers on peppy troll Princess Poppy , who teams up with grumpy pessimist Branch (Justin Timberlake) to rescue her friends from the troll-hungry Bergens.
